<P>v0.1 - (as <I>Zebar</I>) Draws UPC-A. UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13,
Interlaced 2 of 5, Codabar, Code 39, Extended Code 39 and Code 93
barcodes and Add-on codes EAN-2 and EAN-5 without parity. 13/11/2006</P>
<P>v0.2 - Added Code 128 (which is now the default), Code 11, Code 2
of 5, Add-on codes EAN-2 and EAN-5 parity and MSI/Plessey without
check digit. 12/12/2006</P>
<P>v0.3 - Added MSI/Plessey Mod 10 check and 2 x Mod 10 check
options, Telepen ASCII and Telepen numeric, Postnet, RM4SCC. Code has
been tidied up quite a bit. Bind option added. 30/12/2006</P>
<P>v0.4 - Added barcode stacking (now stacks up to 16 barcodes) and
Code16k (stub). 15/1/2007</P>
<P>v0.5 - Added Australia Post 4-State Barcodes and Pharmacode (1 and
2 track). 4-state codes now draw with correct height/width ratio.
28/2/2007</P>
<P>v0.6 - Added Plessey and some derivative codes (EAN-128, Code 128
subset B, Auspost Reply, Auspost Routing, Auspost Redirect, ITF-14).
Tidied up code again: separated symbologies into more files and put
all lookup tables into arrays (much reducing the amount of code,
especially for Code 39e and Code 93). Errors now output to stderr.
Added proper input verification. Distribution now packs with this
HTML page instead of separate README. Outputs to PNG. Outputs colour.
User variable whitespace and border width. Box option. Fixed EAN
add-on bug. Added whitespace and height options. Project name changed
to Zint to avoid conflict with extant trade name. Added escape
character input. 1/4/2007</P>
<P>v1.0 - Corrected problem with escape character codes. Supports
PDF417. This completes the list of features I originally wanted (plus
a few more), hence skip to version 1.0. 20/4/2007</P>
<P>v1.1 - Added more derivatives (Code 2 of 5 Matrix, IATA and Data
Logic, Truncated PDF417, Deutsche Post Leitcode and Identcode,
Pharmazentralnummer, Planet) and Flattermarken. Tidied up 2 of 5
code. 26/4/2007</P>
<P>v1.2 - Supports Data Matrix (by absorption of IEC16022 code by
Stefan Schmidt et al). Added reverse colours, FIM, MSI/Plessey Modulo
11 and Modulo 11/10. Corrected Code 16k check digit calculation.
28/5/2007</P>
<P>v1.3 - Supports USPS OneCode and LOGMARS. Brought all usage
information into one User Manual document. 13/6/2007</P>
<P>v1.4 - Added NVE-18 support. Corrected some problems with
compilation and input verification. Added zint.1 man page. Command
line option handling now uses getopt(), and all the switches have
changed. Added --font option. 20/6/2007</P>
<P>v1.5 - Pulled everything together to make an API. Corrected errors
with EAN-13, PDF417 and LOGMARS. Added EPS output. Added QR Code
support using libqrencode. Corrected ISBN verification error.
Re-compiled documentation in HTML form. Put in place proper error
handling routines. --font option removed. Encoding is now done with a
restructured zint_symbol structure. Added make install option and
optional QR Code support to Makefile. Corrected minor problem with
4-State Codes. Restructured code into fewer source code files. Added
MicroPDF417 support. 12/8/2007</P>
<P>v1.5.1 - Added formatting code to EPS output of EAN and UPC
symbols according to EN 797:1996. Checked against and, where
appropriate, altered or corrected to comply with ISO 16388 and ISO
15417 including Latin-1 support. Altered default image settings,
added automatic ITF border. Corrected error with USPS OneCode. Tidied
up Code 39 quite a bit, added Mod 43 options. 3/9/2007</P>
<P>v1.5.2 - Added extended ASCII support to Code 16k. Corrected Code
128 error. Added Maxicode support by integrating code by John Lien.
26/9/2007</P>
<P>v1.5.3 - Made huge corrections to Maxicode support by removing and
re-writing much of John's code. Maxicode now supports extended ASCII
and modes 4, 5 and 6. 10/10/2007</P>
<P>v1.5.4 - Added GS1 DataBar (Reduced Space Symbology) support.
26/11/2007</P>
<P>v1.5.5 - Added composite symbology support. Corrected errors with
GS1-128 and PDF417/MicroPDF417 byte processing. Transferred licence
to GPL version 3. 9/3/2008</P>
<P>v1.6 – Data Matrix, Maxicode and Australia Post now use common
Reed-Solomon functions – this also fixes a bug in Maxicode error
correction and replaces the last of the Lien code. Added PNG output
for Maxicode symbols. Removed some useless code. Updated QR support
for <I>libqrencode</I> v2.0.0. 22/4/2008</P>
