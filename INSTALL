        INSTALLING eXaro

1.  Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

        tar xvfa exaro-X.Y.Z.tar.lzma          # unpack it

    This creates the directory exaro-X.Y.Z containing the files
    from the archive.

2. Before you jump to build eXaro you should install the fllowing librraries:

 - propertyEditor http://code.google.com/p/propertyeditor/downloads/list it is used to build the report designer.
 - Zint http://www.zint.org.uk/  it is used to build barcode plugin, remember this plugin is build only if you choose GPL license for eXaro.
 - quazip http://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/ (you can download a "cmaked" snapshot from http://code.google.com/p/exaro/downloads/list) 
    it is used to build ods export plugin.
 
3. Configure and build
  We will use shadow builds for this. Shadow building means building outside the source directory tree. 
  It is of course possible to build eXaro inside the source tree, but use shadow builds anyway. 
  You will thank me later: With shadow builds you can have several different build configurations side by side.

Create a build directory, and cd into it:

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build

Running the configure script from inside the build directory sets up the shadow build:
 $ cmake ../exaro-X.Y.Z [ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_install_prefix ]
 
Now compile eXaro
 $ make [-jnumber_of_cpus+1 ]

In order to use eXaro you have to install it. To do this type:
 $ sudo make install


4. That's all. eXaro is now installed. We hope you will enjoy using eXaro!
